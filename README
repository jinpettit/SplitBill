1. My app is a group payment splitting tool that lets users scan receipts, assign items to participants, and instantly calculate how much each person owes. Using the google cloud vision API it extracts text from receipts, organizes the data, and simplifies bill-splitting without the need for manual entry. All processing is done locally, keeping the app fast and private.
